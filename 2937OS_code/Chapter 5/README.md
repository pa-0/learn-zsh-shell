# Chapter 5: Completion

This file applies to the code written for the fifth chapter.

## Usage

Copy the provided files into your `$HOME` folder. Open up a terminal emulator running zsh and `source` the `zshrc.zsh` file:

    % source ~/zshrc.zsh

The file includes a custom configuration for the different aspects of the shell discussed on the fifth chapter of the book.

File `functions.zsh` is optional and can be sourced directly from a running terminal session, just `source /path/to/file/functions.zsh` and you'll be all set.

**NOTES**

* Remember to source the files from their absolute path location, like the provided $HOME example above
* Update the filenames to match the `source` command accordingly, should you rename them
