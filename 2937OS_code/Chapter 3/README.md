# Chapter 3: Advanced Editing

These files apply to the code written for the third chapter.

## Usage

Copy the provided files to your `$HOME` folder. Open up a terminal emulator running zsh and `source` the provided `zshrc.zsh` file:

    % source zshrc.zsh

This will in turn source the provided `keybinds.zsh` file, which contains a custom configuration for the different key bindings and options in order to follow whatÂ´s discussed on the third chapter of the book.

**NOTES**

* Remember to source the files from their absolute path location, like the provided $HOME example above
* Update the filenames to match the `source` command accordingly, should you rename them
* Update the path to the files accordingly, e.g. if you use `keybinds.zsh` as `$HOME/.keybinds`, then any references to other files should be updated too
